Pattern 1: Sliding Window
In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. For example, take a look at this problem:

Find Averages of Sub Arrays
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/

Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size K in it.

Lets understand this problem with a real input:

Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], K=5

A brute-force algorithm will calculate the sum of every 5-element contiguous subarray of the given array and divide the sum by 5 to find the average.
